# Software Renderer

My implementation of a software renderer for learning purposes! I chose not to use a graphics API / hardware acceleration
because I wanted to learn more about the graphics pipeline. This project only has SDL2 for window & input management, and nlohmann json parser to create scenes easier.

### Features

* Cross platform
* Minimal dependencies
* Back-face culling
* frustum culling
* Shader based
* Perspective correct interpolation
* Homogeneous clipping
* Physically based rendering (PBR) - Cook-Terrance BRDF
* Depth testing
* Blinn-Phong reflection model
* Metallic-roughness workflow
* Tangent space normal mapping

* Simple math library
* .Obj file parser
* SDL2 window management
* OpenMP multithreading
* stb_image for image/texture loading
* nlohmann json parser for scene descriptor jsons

### Goals
* Add Scene switching options
* bilinear texture filtering
* SIMD vectorization
* fixing frustum culling on the right side
* better documentation
